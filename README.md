# Outpost Omega - Another Space Station 13 remake

## Read this
Welcome to my 'little' project

## What is this project?
Outpost Omega is a PC game I am currently working on. You work on a space station with about 30 to 100 other players. The goal is to keep the station going but a small amount of players work against you.
