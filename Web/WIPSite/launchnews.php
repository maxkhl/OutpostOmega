	<h1><span class="warn">Using Avast?</span></h1>
	<p>The antivirus software Avast is known to block this launcher. <i>(simply because it doesn't know it good enough)</i> If you feel brave enough you can disable it while downloading the game with this launcher. Unfortunately there is no other way for you to play Outpost Omega right now. :(</p>
	<h1>Want to share this game?</h1>
	<p>Feel free to do so! Here's the (direct) download link for the launcher:</p>
	<p><a href="http://download.outpost-omega.com/">http://download.outpost-omega.com/</a></p>
	<p>Just do me the favor and don't post it somewhere yet. I'm not prepared for a lot of downloads and I don't think the game is in a state that should be seen by everyone.</p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0041</span></h1>
<p>This update is mainly focused on bugfixes and mod framework enhancements. <span class="sign">MaxKhl 10.12.2015</span>
</p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.004</span></h1>
<p>Took me a while for this patch. I was fighting hard with the multiplayer and am still not done. In the past I lost a lot of time polishing those pre pre pre... something releases. In the future I will mostly release experimental versions so expect the game to crash. This update contains a crash-window that will show detailed information about the crash and my mail adress. Also the unstable and buggy multiplayer is in there now. Also expect a LOT of bugs because this version contains a lot of untested stuff.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 15.10.2015</span>
</p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0031</span></h1>
<p>This patch contains a lot of fixes and is focused mainly on modding and performance. The modding api should work completely now and the game is able to handle a LOT more gameobjects than before. <span class="sign">MaxKhl 31.05.2015</span>
</p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0030</span></h1>
<p>This patch took me almost a whole month. I had a lot of major issues that had to be solved and I planned a bit too much. But finally I got everything done and it's working pretty smooth. At least on my hardware. :S<br />
Okay. Here a short list of the new stuff in this build: very experimental multiplayer, lua-modding, rotation while spawning (Scrollwheel), ingame lua console, reporting for minor and major crashes (this system adds a lot more stability), animated gifs, most screen resizing issues fixed, loading screen and a lot of bugs fixed<span class="sign">MaxKhl 13.05.2015</span>
</p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0026</span></h1>
<p>Next patch out! We got a brand new, a bit better looking, skybox. There is also a spawn menu implemented. Just click on the "+" symbol to open it. Select a item and then spawn it with your left mousebutton. Right mousebutton to remove stuff. Object rotation will come with the next patch. There is also a experimental video player but it might has convertion problems on your local machine. Still working on it.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 18.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0025</span></h1>
<p>Took me a while for this patch because it caused so many bugs I had to fix. Basically I did a lot of fine-tuning, implemented a performance/debug tool (press P), slapped a intro on the gamestart, made a shit looking space station that rotates in the background of the main menu and implemented a skysphere with a horrible texture on it. So yeah... enjoy :X - oh and I did a lot of stuff in the background that clears the way to a creative mode in the next patch!<span class="sign">MaxKhl 09.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0024</span></h1>
<p>More bugs fixed. Rotation of equipted items works now. Objects are now aligned to the block space. Changed the testlevel to a more interesting look.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 04.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0023</span></h1>
<p>Some bugs fixed. New item (knife) and 2 objects (frame and airlock) added.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 04.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0022</span></h1>
<p>Already the next update. Did some small changes and implemented a new UI control that can display a life rendered game scene. (Used inside the inventory and screenmanager) This is important for the computer terminals that will be implemented later. <span class="sign">MaxKhl 02.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.00211</span></h1>
<p>Small bug fixed. <span class="sign">MaxKhl 01.04.2015</span></p>

<h1><span class="warn">IMPORTANT!</span></h1>
<p>You need a new launcher again... sorreh. :( You need to download the newest version <a href="http://download.outpost-omega.com/">here</a>, de-install the old one and install the new launcher.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 01.04.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0021</span></h1>
<p>First experimental item- and inventory-system. Pick up the wrench by looking at it and pressing E. Go to the inventory (top right "I" icon) and equipt it. Q to drop it again. Nothing else to do with that currently. To build blocks, press B to enter build mode and then use your right and left mouse button to add/remove blocks.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 01.04.2015</span></p>

<h1><span class="warn">IMPORTANT!</span></h1>
<p>The old launcher had a bug in its update logic. You need to download the newest version <a href="http://download.outpost-omega.com/">here</a>, de-install the old one and install the new launcher.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 31.03.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0020</span></h1>
<p>This is the new polished version. Every bad bug got fixed and it's running pretty smooth. We got some basic model shit ingame and the quicksave stuff works. Careful with closing and restarting new world without exiting the application. RAM usage is building up every time. Problem will be fixed in the next version.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 31.03.2015</span></p>

<h1><span class="warn">IMPORTANT!</span></h1>
<p>Looks like the game does not close properly. Please kill the "Outpost-Omega.exe" process in your taskmanager (ctrl + alt + delete) after you closed the game.<span class="sign">MaxKhl 16.03.2015</span></p>

<h1>Version <span class="ver">0.0019</span></h1>
<p>Initial test-release. First version running on the new launcher! Everything pretty experimental and buggy. Will release more stuff soon. <span class="sign">MaxKhl 15.03.2015</span></p>
